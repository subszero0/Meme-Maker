# Download Fix Verification Guide

## ✅ Issue Resolved: Download Button "Not Found" Error

### Root Cause Identified
The download button was generating URLs **without** the `/v1` API prefix:
```
❌ WRONG: localhost:8000/api/jobs/{job_id}/download  
✅ FIXED: localhost:8000/api/v1/jobs/{job_id}/download
```

### Fix Applied
- **File**: `backend/app/storage.py` line 132
- **Problem**: `get_download_url()` method was missing `/v1` prefix
- **Solution**: Added `/v1` to the download URL generation
- **Status**: ✅ Backend restarted with fix

### Verification Steps

1. **Test existing completed job**:
   - The job `9c7296df-b1eb-40d5-997e-0d2fbdfba19d` should now have working download
   - Hard refresh browser (`Ctrl + Shift + R`)
   - Click "Download MP4" button
   - Should download: `Defiant_Iran_claims_to_gain_control_of_skies_over_Israeli_cities_Arrow_3_fails_Janta_Ka_Reporter_9c7296df-b1eb-40d5-997e-0d2fbdfba19d.mp4`

2. **Test new job workflow**:
   - Create a new job with any YouTube URL
   - Wait for 100% completion
   - Download button should work immediately

### Technical Confirmation
✅ **Direct API test passed**:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/jobs/9c7296df-b1eb-40d5-997e-0d2fbdfba19d/download"
# Returns: 319,085 bytes MP4 file successfully
```

### Complete Fix Summary

1. ✅ **Frontend API calls**: Fixed to use `/api/v1/` 
2. ✅ **Backend endpoints**: Already had `/api/v1/` prefix
3. ✅ **Storage system**: Fixed UNKNOWN_ERROR  
4. ✅ **Download URLs**: Fixed to use `/api/v1/` prefix
