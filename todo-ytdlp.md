# TODO: yt-dlp Video Download Issues Resolution

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This document outlines the systematic resolution of two critical issues affecting video download quality:
1. **Resolution picker has no effect** - User selection ignored, always downloads at platform default
2. **Consistent 2-3° clockwise rotation** - All downloaded videos show geometric tilt regardless of platform

**Root Cause Analysis Complete**: Both issues stem from architectural mismatches and baked-in video distortion at the platform level.

## 🔍 Issue A: Resolution Picker Ineffective

### Problem Statement
- Frontend sends `resolution: "720p"` to API
- Backend expects `format_id: "22"` 
- yt-dlp downloads platform default regardless of user selection
- Final clips maintain incorrect resolution

### Root Cause Analysis
```
Frontend (resolution) → API (format_id) → yt-dlp (format selection) → Downloaded file
     ❌ Mismatch          ❌ Ignored           ❌ Default used
```

**Dependency Chain Analysis**:
1. **Frontend Components**:
   - `frontend-new/src/types/job.ts` → Defines `JobCreate.resolution?: string`
   - `frontend-new/src/components/UrlInput.tsx` → Collects resolution selection
   - `frontend-new/src/lib/api/jobs.ts` → Sends payload to backend

2. **Backend API Layer**:
   - `backend/app/api/jobs.py` → Expects `format_id` in `JobCreateRequest`
   - `backend/app/services/job_service.py` → Passes `format_id` to worker

3. **Worker Processing**:
   - `worker/utils/ytdlp_options.py` → Uses `format_id` in yt-dlp options
   - `worker/video/downloader.py` → Executes download with format selection

### Impact Assessment

**Direct Dependencies**:
- Frontend resolution picker UI becomes non-functional
- User experience degraded (false sense of control)
- Storage optimization impossible (always gets platform default)

**Secondary Dependencies**:
- Video processing pipeline receives inconsistent input resolutions
- Trimming/clipping operations work on suboptimal source material
- Bandwidth usage potentially higher than necessary

**Tertiary Dependencies**:
- User retention affected by poor video quality control
- Support requests increase due to unexpected resolution behavior
- Platform costs may be higher due to larger file processing

### Resolution Strategy

#### Option 1: Format ID Mapping (Recommended)
Create resolution-to-format_id mapping for major platforms:

**Changes Required**:
1. **Frontend** (`frontend-new/src/types/job.ts`):
   ```typescript
   // Change from:
   resolution?: string;
   // To:
   format_id?: string;
   ```

2. **Frontend** (`frontend-new/src/components/UrlInput.tsx`):
   - Add platform detection logic
   - Map resolution selection to appropriate format_id
   - Send `format_id` instead of `resolution`

3. **Backend** (`backend/app/api/jobs.py`):
   - Already expects `format_id` - no changes needed

**Implementation Dependencies**:
- Requires platform-specific format knowledge
- Need fallback logic for unknown platforms
- Testing across YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok

#### Option 2: Backend Mapping Layer
Keep frontend unchanged, add mapping in backend:

**Changes Required**:
1. **Backend** (`backend/app/api/jobs.py`):
   - Accept both `resolution` and `format_id`
   - Add platform detection from URL
   - Map resolution to format_id in backend

**Implementation Dependencies**:
- Requires URL parsing for platform detection
- Platform-specific format mapping logic
- More complex backend logic but simpler frontend

#### Option 3: Dynamic Format Discovery
Query available formats and select best match:

**Changes Required**:
1. **Worker** (`worker/video/downloader.py`):
   - Add format discovery phase before download
   - Select best format matching requested resolution
   - Fallback to platform default if no match

**Implementation Dependencies**:
- Additional yt-dlp call for format listing
- Increased processing time per job
- More robust but slower implementation

### Recommended Implementation Path

**Phase 1: Backend Mapping (Quick Fix)**
1. Modify `backend/app/api/jobs.py` to accept `resolution`
2. Add platform detection utilities
3. Implement basic resolution → format_id mapping
4. Test with major platforms

**Phase 2: Frontend Optimization (Long-term)**
1. Move platform detection to frontend
2. Send format_id directly from frontend
3. Remove backend mapping layer
4. Add format validation

## 🔍 Issue B: Consistent Video Rotation

### Problem Statement
- All downloaded videos show 2-3° clockwise geometric tilt
- Affects all platforms (YouTube, Facebook, Instagram)
- Present in source video before any processing
- Not correctable with simple rotation filters

### Root Cause Analysis
**Confirmed**: The rotation is **baked into the pixel data** of platform-served videos, not metadata.

**Evidence**:
1. Direct yt-dlp download of progressive format (no remuxing) shows tilt
2. `ffprobe` shows no rotation metadata or Display Matrix
3. Same tilt level across all platforms
4. YouTube web player and other services apply hidden correction

### Understanding the Geometric Issue

The problem is **not simple rotation** but **perspective/keystone distortion**:

```
┌─────────────────────┐ ← What we see in raw download
│ ╱               ╲   │
│╱     Content     ╲  │ ← Trapezoid-like distortion
│╲                 ╱  │
│ ╲_______________╱   │
└─────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────┐ ← What players show after correction
│                     │
│      Content        │ ← Rectangular, level content
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Why Simple Rotation Fails**:
- Rotating tilted content creates black triangular voids
- Original pixels were captured/encoded with perspective skew
- No amount of 2D rotation can recover "missing" corner information
- Modern players apply 3D perspective correction, not 2D rotation

### Impact Assessment

**Direct Dependencies**:
- All video outputs appear tilted in standard players
- User perception of video quality degraded
- Professional/commercial use cases affected

**Secondary Dependencies**:
- Video thumbnails appear tilted
- Social media sharing shows poor quality
- Brand perception affected by "amateur" video appearance

**Tertiary Dependencies**:
- User retention due to quality issues
- Competitive disadvantage vs services with corrected output
- Support burden from user complaints

### Resolution Strategy

#### Option 1: Accept Platform Reality (Recommended for MVP)
Document that this is a platform-level encoding issue:

**Implementation**:
1. Add user documentation explaining the tilt
2. Position as "authentic platform content"
3. No code changes required
4. Focus development effort on other features

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Zero development cost
- ✅ No risk of introducing new bugs
- ✅ Preserves original content fidelity
- ❌ Users may perceive quality issues
- ❌ Professional use cases affected

#### Option 2: Perspective Correction Filter
Implement 3D perspective correction instead of 2D rotation:

**Changes Required**:
1. **Worker** (`worker/video/trimmer.py`):
   ```python
   # Replace rotation filter with perspective correction
   # Instead of: rotate=-0.5*PI/180
   # Use: perspective correction matrix
   perspective_filter = (
       f"perspective="
       f"x0=0:y0=0:x1={width}:y1=0:"
       f"x2=0:y2={height}:x3={width}:y3={height}:"
       f"sense=source"
   )
   ```

**Implementation Dependencies**:
- Requires manual calibration of perspective points per platform
- May need different correction matrices for different platforms
- Risk of overcorrection creating different distortions
- Significant testing required across platforms and resolutions

#### Option 3: ML-Based Keystone Correction
Use computer vision to detect and correct perspective automatically:

**Changes Required**:
1. Add OpenCV or similar computer vision library
2. Implement automatic perspective detection
3. Calculate correction matrix dynamically
4. Apply correction during processing

**Implementation Dependencies**:
- Significant new dependency (OpenCV)
- Increased processing time per video
- Complex algorithm requiring maintenance
- May fail on certain content types

#### Option 4: Hybrid Approach - User Choice
Allow users to choose between original and corrected versions:

**Changes Required**:
1. **Frontend**: Add "Correct perspective" checkbox
2. **Backend**: Add perspective correction flag to job
3. **Worker**: Conditionally apply correction based on flag

**Implementation Dependencies**:
- UI complexity increase
- Backend job schema changes
- Worker processing logic changes
- User education required

### Recommended Implementation Path

**Phase 1: Documentation & User Education**
1. Document the tilt as a known platform issue
2. Add FAQ explaining why videos appear tilted
3. Position as preserving "authentic" platform content
4. Monitor user feedback and complaints

**Phase 2: Optional Correction (If User Demand Exists)**
1. Implement basic perspective correction for YouTube content
2. Add user toggle for correction on/off
3. Test extensively with various content types
4. Expand to other platforms based on results

**Phase 3: Advanced Correction (Future)**
1. Implement ML-based automatic detection
2. Platform-specific correction algorithms
3. Real-time preview of correction in UI
