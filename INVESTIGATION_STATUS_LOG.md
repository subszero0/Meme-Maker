# Investigation Status Log

## âœ… Production Underscore URL Investigation - RESOLVED (Jan 2, 2025)

**Status**: Complete - No infrastructure issues found  
**Finding**: URLs with underscores process correctly through all layers  
**Root Cause**: Platform restrictions (Instagram rate limiting) - not infrastructure failures  
**Documentation**: `PRODUCTION_UNDERSCORE_INVESTIGATION_COMPLETE.md`  
**Methodology**: Systematic debugging validated (BP #0, #1, #2, #3, #11)  
**Action Required**: None - system operating as designed  

---

*Future investigations should use this systematic layer-by-layer approach to distinguish platform behavior from infrastructure issues.*
