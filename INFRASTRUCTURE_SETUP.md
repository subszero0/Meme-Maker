# Infrastructure Setup Guide

## 🎯 Current Architecture: Lightsail + Local Storage

Your Meme Maker application is currently deployed using:

- **Host**: Amazon Lightsail instance
- **Storage**: Local filesystem (migrated from S3)
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with SSH deployment

## 📋 Active Configuration

### Storage Backend
```bash
STORAGE_BACKEND=local  # ✅ Active
CLIPS_DIR=/app/clips    # Local storage directory
# No S3 credentials needed for file storage!
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Active**: `.github/workflows/ci-cd-lightsail.yml`
- **Disabled**: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` (AWS ECS version)

### Required GitHub Secrets (for Lightsail deployment)
```bash
LIGHTSAIL_HOST       # Your Lightsail instance IP
LIGHTSAIL_USER       # SSH username (usually 'ubuntu')
LIGHTSAIL_SSH_KEY    # Private SSH key for access
```

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Options

### Option A: Current Lightsail Setup (Recommended) ✅
**What you're using now**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple deployment (Docker Compose)
- ✅ Fixed monthly cost
- ✅ Local storage (faster, no S3 fees)
- ✅ Easy debugging and monitoring
- ✅ No complex AWS infrastructure

**Cons:**
- ❌ Single point of failure
- ❌ Manual scaling required
- ❌ No auto-scaling

**Files involved:**
- `docker-compose.yaml`
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd-lightsail.yml`
- `live-deployment-lightsail.md`

### Option B: AWS ECS with S3 (Available but disabled)
**Infrastructure for enterprise scale**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Auto-scaling
- ✅ High availability
- ✅ Managed infrastructure
- ✅ Global CDN potential

**Cons:**
- ❌ Complex setup
- ❌ Higher costs
- ❌ Requires AWS expertise
- ❌ S3 storage costs

**Files involved:**
- `infra/terraform/` (Infrastructure as Code)
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` (Currently disabled)

## 🔄 S3 References Explained

You're seeing S3 references in two contexts:

### 1. Application Storage (MIGRATED ✅)
- **Status**: ✅ Fully migrated to local storage
- **Location**: Backend application code
- **Purpose**: File storage for processed videos
- **Current**: Uses local filesystem

### 2. Infrastructure Deployment (PRESENT but UNUSED)
- **Status**: ⚠️ Present but disabled
- **Location**: Terraform files and AWS ECS CI/CD
- **Purpose**: AWS infrastructure provisioning
- **Current**: Not used (you're using Lightsail instead)

## 🚨 Why AWS References Still Exist

The Terraform files (`infra/terraform/`) and AWS ECS CI/CD pipeline contain S3 references because they're designed for **AWS ECS deployment**. These are **not used** in your current Lightsail setup.

**These S3 references are for:**
1. **Terraform state storage** (infrastructure management)
2. **Container image storage** (AWS ECR)
3. **Load balancer configuration** (AWS ALB)
4. **Legacy file storage** (replaced by local storage)

## 📊 Quick Status Check

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Application Storage** | ✅ Local | S3 migration complete |
| **Active CI/CD** | ✅ Lightsail | Simple SSH deployment |
| **AWS ECS CI/CD** | ⚠️ Disabled | Available for future use |
| **Terraform Infrastructure** | ⚠️ Unused | AWS ECS resources |

## 🛠️ What to Do Now

### If you want to stick with Lightsail (Recommended):
1. ✅ **Nothing!** Your current setup is working perfectly
2. ✅ Use the active Lightsail CI/CD pipeline
3. ✅ Ignore the Terraform/AWS ECS files (they're for reference)

### If you want to clean up AWS references:
```bash
# Optional cleanup (removes AWS ECS option entirely)
rm -rf infra/terraform/
rm .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
```

### If you want to migrate to AWS ECS later:
1. Enable the AWS ECS CI/CD workflow
2. Provision infrastructure using Terraform
3. Configure AWS credentials
4. Update deployment process

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### "Why do I see S3 in my codebase?"
- **Answer**: Two reasons: legacy migration scripts and unused AWS infrastructure
- **Action**: Ignore them - your app uses local storage

### "Do I need AWS credentials?"
- **For current Lightsail setup**: ❌ No
- **For AWS ECS deployment**: ✅ Yes (but you're not using it)

### "Is my storage working correctly?"
- **Check**: `curl http://your-lightsail-ip:8000/api/v1/storage/metrics`
- **Expected**: `{"storage_backend": "local", ...}`

## 🎯 Summary

Your setup is **perfect for your needs**:
- ✅ **Lightsail hosting** - simple and cost-effective
- ✅ **Local storage** - fast and free
- ✅ **Docker Compose** - easy deployment
- ✅ **GitHub Actions** - automated CI/CD

The S3/AWS references you see are **infrastructure alternatives** that aren't being used. Your application storage migration is complete and working great!
