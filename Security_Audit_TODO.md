### 🔴 MANDATORY TESTING SEQUENCE FOR CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES
```bash
# DAY 1 CRITICAL TESTING PROTOCOL
# Test in isolated environment first, then staging, NEVER production

# 1. Command Injection Testing (30 minutes)
curl -X POST "https://staging.memeit.pro/api/clips" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://evil.com/video.mp4\"; touch /tmp/compromised; echo \"", "start": 0, "end": 10}'

# 2. Container Escape Testing (60 minutes)
# Create malicious video file with embedded shell payload
# Submit via API and monitor container behavior

# 3. Queue DoS Testing (30 minutes)  
# Automated script to submit 100+ concurrent jobs
# Monitor system resources and service availability
```

**🚨 SECURITY ALERT**: These vulnerabilities were identified through systematic STRIDE analysis. Failure to address them within 24 hours leaves production system exposed to active exploitation.

**📝 Notes**: This comprehensive security audit plan covers maximum efficiency and maximum security assessment of the Meme Maker production website. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring no security aspect is overlooked. The focus on video processing security (yt-dlp integration) and infrastructure security (Docker/AWS deployment) addresses the specific risks associated with this application architecture.

**⏰ Estimated Timeline**: 10 days for complete audit execution
**👥 Resources Required**: 1-2 security specialists, access to production environment, testing tools and licenses
**💰 Budget Considerations**: Security tool licenses, cloud resources for testing, potential external pentesting services

**🔄 Review Schedule**: This audit plan should be reviewed and updated every 6 months or after major application changes.
