   # macOS/Linux
   cp env.template .env
   ```

2. **Edit the environment file:**
   Open `.env` in a text editor (Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on macOS, or nano on Linux) and update these values:

   ```env
   # Basic Configuration
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
   
   # MinIO (Local S3-compatible storage)
   MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=admin
   MINIO_SECRET_KEY=admin12345
   AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:9000
   S3_BUCKET=clips
   
   # Application Settings
   ENV=development
   LOG_LEVEL=INFO
   CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:8000
   
   # Worker Settings
   WORKER_CONCURRENCY=2
   MAX_CLIP_DURATION=180
   ```

---

## Step 3: Start the Application

### Quick Start (Recommended for first-time users)

1. **Make sure Docker is running:**
   - Look for Docker icon in your system tray/menu bar
   - If not running, start Docker Desktop

2. **Start all services with one command:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will:
   - Build the backend and worker containers
   - Start Redis (for job queue)
   - Start MinIO (for file storage)
   - Start the backend API
   - Start the worker process
   - Build and serve the frontend

3. **Wait for everything to start:**
   - You'll see lots of log messages
   - Wait until you see messages like:
     ```
     meme-backend | INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
     meme-frontend | ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000
     ```

### Alternative: Development Mode (for developers)

If you want to run components separately for development:

1. **Start infrastructure services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up redis minio -d
   ```

2. **Start the backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   # Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

3. **Start the worker (in a new terminal):**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   # Activate virtual environment first (same as above)
   python -m app.worker
   ```

4. **Start the frontend (in another new terminal):**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## Step 4: Access the Application

Once everything is running, you can access:

### üåê **Main Application (Frontend)**
- **URL:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- This is the main user interface where you'll clip videos

### üîß **API Documentation**
- **URL:** [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI)

### üìä **MinIO Storage Interface**
- **URL:** [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001)
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin12345`
- View uploaded files and clips

### üîç **Health Check**
- **URL:** [http://localhost:8000/health](http://localhost:8000/health)
- Should return `{"status": "healthy"}`

---

## Step 5: Using the Application

Now you can use Meme Maker as an end user:

### 1. **Open the Application**
- Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser
- You should see the Meme Maker homepage

### 2. **Clip a Video**

**Step 2.1: Paste a Video URL**
- Find a public video on YouTube, Instagram, or other supported platforms
- Copy the video URL (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`)
- Paste it into the URL input field
- Click "Load Video" or "Get Video Info"

**Step 2.2: Preview the Video**
- The video will load in the preview player
- You can play/pause to find the part you want to clip

**Step 2.3: Set Clip Start and End Times**
- Use the timeline slider to select the start and end points
- Or manually enter times in the format `mm:ss` (e.g., `01:30` for 1 minute 30 seconds)
- Maximum clip length is 3 minutes

**Step 2.4: Start Clipping**
- Check the "I have the right to download this content" checkbox
- Click "Create Clip" or "Download Clip"

**Step 2.5: Download Your Clip**
- The system will process your request (this may take 10-60 seconds)
- Once ready, a download link will appear
- Click to download your clipped video file

### 3. **Check Processing Status**
- If the clip takes time to process, you'll see a progress indicator
- The job queue processes clips in order
- Large files or complex clips may take longer

## Step 6: Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem: "Docker is not running"**
- **Solution:** Start Docker Desktop and wait for it to fully load

**Problem: "Port already in use"**
- **Solution:** Stop other applications using the same ports, or change ports in the configuration

**Problem: "Cannot connect to Redis"**
- **Solution:** Make sure Redis container is running: `docker-compose up redis -d`

**Problem: "Frontend not loading"**
- **Solution:** Check if the frontend container is running and accessible at http://localhost:3000

**Problem: "Video download fails"**
- **Solution:** 
  - Ensure the video URL is public and accessible
  - Check that the video platform is supported
  - Verify your internet connection

**Problem: "Clip processing is stuck"**
- **Solution:**
  - Check worker logs: `docker-compose logs worker`
  - Restart the worker: `docker-compose restart worker`

### Viewing Logs

To see what's happening behind the scenes:

```bash
# View all logs
docker-compose logs

# View specific service logs
docker-compose logs backend
docker-compose logs worker
docker-compose logs frontend

# Follow logs in real-time
docker-compose logs -f backend
```

### Stopping the Application

When you're done:

```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove all data
docker-compose down -v
```
