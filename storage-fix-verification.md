# Storage Fix Verification Guide

## ✅ Issue Resolved: UNKNOWN_ERROR Storage Problem

### Root Cause Identified
The job was failing with "UNKNOWN_ERROR" at 90% completion due to:
```
AttributeError: module 'aiofiles.os' has no attribute 'sync'
```

### Fix Applied
- **File**: `backend/app/storage.py`
- **Problem**: Lines 61 called `await aiofiles.os.sync()` which doesn't exist in aiofiles library
- **Solution**: Removed the non-existent method calls and added proper comments
- **Status**: ✅ Worker rebuilt and restarted with fix

### How to Test the Fix

1. **Hard refresh browser**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` to clear cache
2. **Test with YouTube URL**: Use `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ` 
3. **Check console**: Should show `/api/v1/` calls without 404/500 errors
4. **Verify job completion**: Job should now complete successfully without UNKNOWN_ERROR

### Expected Behavior After Fix
```
✅ Job progress: 35% - Trimming video...
✅ Job progress: 50% - Processing video...  
✅ Job progress: 70% - Finalizing clip...
✅ Job progress: 90% - Saving to storage...
✅ Job progress: 100% - Complete!
```

### Services Status
- ✅ Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Backend: http://localhost:8000 (API endpoints working)
- ✅ Worker: Rebuilt with storage fix
- ✅ Redis: Connected and polling

### Files Modified
1. `backend/app/storage.py` - Removed `aiofiles.os.sync()` calls
2. Worker container - Rebuilt with storage fix

### Next Steps
1. Test a complete workflow end-to-end
2. Verify download links work properly
3. Confirm no more UNKNOWN_ERROR messages
